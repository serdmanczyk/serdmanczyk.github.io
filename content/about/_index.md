![My stupid face](/images/robome.jpg)

I earned my [Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering](http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jmconrad/Graduate_students.htm#GraduatedMSThesis) at the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](http://ece.uncc.edu/graduate-program/masters-program).  My thesis focused on [networking mobile robots](http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jmconrad/GradStudents/Thesis_Erdmanczyk.pdf).  I blogged about it [here](/MSEEThesis/).

I currently work as a Senior Automation Engineer with Disney in Seatte, WA where I focus on automating tasks on behalf of systems engineers.

While I'm not spending free time with my son, wife, or dog.  I sometimes hobby with Golang, Python, and electronics/robotics.  I post about technical musings here.
